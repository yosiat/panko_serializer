# Panko

![Build Status](https://github.com/panko-serializer/panko_serializer/workflows/Panko%20Serializer%20CI/badge.svg?branch=master)

Panko is library which is inspired by ActiveModelSerializers 0.9 for serializing ActiveRecord/Ruby objects to JSON strings, fast.

To achieve it's [performance](https://panko.dev/docs/performance.html):

* Oj - Panko relies Oj since it's fast and allow to serialize incrementally using `Oj::StringWriter`
* Serialization Descriptor - Panko computes most of the metadata ahead of time, to save time later in serialization.
* Type casting â€” Panko does type casting by it's self, instead of relying on ActiveRecord.

To dig deeper about the performance choices, read [Design Choices](https://panko.dev/docs/design-choices.html).
